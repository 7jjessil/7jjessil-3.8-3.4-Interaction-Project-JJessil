		</div>
	<div class= "tip_2">
		<h2>Tip 2</h2>
		<p>Make sure to take lots of good pictures and videos, because if you forget now you can remember your experience all over again!<p>
		</div>
		
	<div class= "tip_3">
		<h2>Tip 3</h2>
		<p>Remember you can ask your tour guides questions, there is a good chance that they know a lot about the animals and location than you do! <p>
		</div>

	<div class= "tip_4">
		<h2>Tip 4</h2>
		<p>This is your safari and the tour guide just wants to make sure you are safe and well having a blast, so don't be afraid to ask the driver to stop so you can take pictures and admire the animals!<p>

		<div class="text"><h1>Lion</h1><h2>Panthera Leo</h2><p>If in contact with a lion, stand your ground, retreating very slowly, continuing to face the lion while clapping your hands, shouting and waving your arms around to make yourself look bigger.

		<div class="text"><h1>Cheetah</h1><h2>Acinonyx jubatus</h2><p>Bring along with you recorded lion and hyena calls, these can dissuade them from following you, if this doesn't work try intimidating it by waving your arms above your head and yelling at it.

		<div class="text"><h1>Hippopotamus</h1><h2>Hippopotamus amphibius</h2><p>Don't try to outrun a hippo. Seek cover immediately. If no buildings or vehicles are in sight, use natural cover and obstacles like trees, rocks, hills, and termite mounds to slow the hippo’s momentum. If a hippo charges you, it's because you have intruded on its territory. So once you gain enough distance, it should give up the chase.<p></div>

If the rhino misses while it is chasing you one way, turn and run in the opposite direction. They rarely continue attacking in the opposite direction.<p></div>
